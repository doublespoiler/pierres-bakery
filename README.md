## Description

This application presents the user with a storefront application to buy bread. The application displays the prices, and prompts the user to press any key to continue. Then they put how many loaves of bread they want as an integer into the console and press enter. Then they enter how many pastries they want and press enter. If the user does not put a valid answer, the program repeats the prompt.

After the user has chosen their bread and pastries, the program prints a reciept with the subtotals of each category of item, how many were purchased, and the total. The program exits after the user presses a key.
